## 📖 About

Game save files are stored in different places across OS platforms, which can make syncing a challenge.
EmuSync aims to simplify this by mapping locations from multiple devices to a single sync point, using your chosen cloud storage provider as the storage point.

Easily set up which games you want to keep backed up and let EmuSync handle the rest! It even works in Gaming mode on the SteamDeck - check out the Decky plugin [here](https://github.com/emu-sync/EmuSync-DeckyPlugin).

- If you're having trouble with EmuSync, or want to see in more detail how to use it, please see our [Wiki](https://github.com/emu-sync/EmuSync/wiki).

## 🖥️ What devices does EmuSync work on?

EmuSync has primarily been designed and developed for a Windows PC and Steam Deck, but it **_should_** work on any modern Windows or Linux device. 

> ℹ️ **Please note:** I'm currently unable to build and test on Mac.

I currently have no plans to develop an Android and/or iOS version of EmuSync - sorry for any gamers this applies to!

Confirmed working devices (but not limited to):
| Device | Status |
|-|-|
| Windows 10 PC - x64 | ✅ |
| Windows 11 PC - x64 | ✅ |

## 🚀 Getting started
With EmuSync installed, you first need to log in to your storage provider. This is where EmuSync will store your game saves, as well as using it as a pseudo database.

### 💾 Setting up a storage provider
1. Go to `This device`.
1. In the `Storage provider` section, select one of the available storage providers.
1. A window should pop up, prompting you to log in and grant EmuSync permission.
1. After you've successfully logged in, close the window.
1. You should now see your linked storage provider!

Now you've linked a storage provider, you can start defining your games and where their save locations are.

### 🎮 Setting up a game sync
